## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to build a predictive model using regression techniques. This project covers:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Selection and Evaluation
- End-to-end pipeline creation
- Deployment using Streamlit

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is included in the repository (or specify source if external).  
It contains features relevant to predicting the target variable using regression.

Key steps performed on the dataset:

- Handling missing values
- Scaling/normalizing features
- Encoding categorical variables (if any)

## Tech Stack

- **Python** – Main programming language  
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine Learning models and evaluation  
- **Streamlit** – Deployment and interactive web app

## Project Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaning missing or inconsistent values  
   - Encoding categorical features  
   - Scaling numerical features  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualizing data distributions  
   - Correlation analysis  

3. **Modeling**  
   - Ridge
   - Random Forest Regression  
   

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
   - R² Score  

5. **Deployment**  
   - Streamlit app for user-friendly predictions  
   - Users can input values manually

## Evaluation Metrics

The performance of regression models is measured using:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** – Average of absolute differences between predicted and actual values  
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** – Average of squared differences between predicted and actual values  
- **R² Score** – Proportion of variance explained by the model

## Deployment

A simple **Streamlit app** is included for making predictions with the trained regression model.  

To run the app:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py

How to Run :

1 - Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Ashutosh863/Regression-Project.git

2 -Navigate to the project directory:
cd Regression-Project

3 - Install required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4 -Run the Streamlit application:

streamlit run app.py
